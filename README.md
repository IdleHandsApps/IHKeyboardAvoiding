IHKeyboardAvoiding [![Language: Swift 4.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-4.2-orange.svg)](https://swift.org)
------------------------------

An elegant solution for keeping any UIView visible when the keyboard is being shown

![alt demo](https://github.com/IdleHandsApps/IHKeyboardAvoiding/blob/gh-pages/IHKeyboardAvoidingDemo.gif)

## Requirements

|                  |  IHKeyboardAvoiding Version  |
|------------------|--------------------|
|    Objective C   |        2.6.0       |
|       Swift      |        3.0.0 +     |

## Description

IHKeyboardAvoiding will translate any UIView up when the keyboard is being shown, then return it when the keyboard is hidden.  

Register an ```avoidingView```(UIView) with IHKeyboardAvoiding; when the keyboard is shown, if  the ```avoidingView's``` frame will be intersected by the keyboard, then it will move up just above the keyboard. When the keyboard is dismissed, the ```avoidingView``` is returned to its original position.

What sets IHKeyboardAvoiding apart from other keyboard avoiding solutions is that it doesn't require placing your content in a UIScrollView.  No scroll view is used. And it isn't restricted to keeping UITextFields visible, with IHKeyboardAvoiding any UIView can avoid the keyboard

If Autolayout is used then the constraints are animated, otherwise a CGAffine translation is done.

## Supported Features

* iPhone keyboard
* iPad docked keyboard
* iPad undocked keyboard
* iPad split keyboard
* landscape & protrait
* 3rd party keyboards
* Auto Layout
* AutoResizingMask (Springs & Struts)

## How to install

Add this to your CocoaPods Podfile.
```
pod 'IHKeyboardAvoiding'
```

## How to use

To set the avoiding view
```swift
KeyboardAvoiding.avoidingView = self.avoidingView
```

Put it in ```viewDidLoad()``` or ```viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool)``` depending on your usage

If you're unsure put it in ```viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool)```

If you need to set the avoidingView, or its properites, dynamically consider putting it in ```textViewShouldBeginEditing(_ textView: UITextView)```

Optional methods    
```KeyboardAvoiding.setAvoidingView(self.avoidingView, withTriggerView: self.triggerView)``` Use this to set an avoidingView but have a different view that triggers the avoiding. If a triggerView's frame will be intersected by the keyboard, then the avoidingView will be moved so that the triggerView is above the keyboard
```KeyboardAvoiding.buffer``` The avoidingView will move if the keyboard is within ```buffer``` points of the triggerView's frame.  Default buffer is 0  
```KeyboardAvoiding.paddingForCurrentAvoidingView``` The padding to put between the keyboard and triggerView.  Default padding is 0

Enable tap to dismiss the keyboard by simply changing any UIView to be an instance of KeyboardDismissingView in you nib/storyboard

## IHKeyboardAvoiding vs UIScrollView solutions - Fight, fight!
UIScrollView pros:
* They're quick n easy

IHKeyboardAvoiding pros:
* You dont have scrollviews littered throughout your app
* Having multiple scrollviews in your view heirarchy can cause problems
* When the keyboard hides, scrollviews dont always scroll back to their original position
* Scrollviews only scroll enough to keep the focused textfield visible
* IHKeyboardAvoiding provides control over which UIViews are visible when the keyboard appears
